# IPv6 Privacy Extensions (RFC 4941)
# ---
# IPv6 typically uses a device's MAC address when choosing an IPv6 address
# to use in autoconfiguration. Privacy extensions allow using a randomly
# generated IPv6 address, which increases privacy.
#
# Acceptable values:
#    0 - donâ€™t use privacy extensions.
#    1 - generate privacy addresses
#    2 - prefer privacy addresses and use them over the normal addresses.

# The magic SysRq key enables certain keyboard combinations to be
# interpreted by the kernel to help with debugging. The kernel will respond
# to these keys regardless of the current running applications.
#
# In general, the magic SysRq key is not needed for the average Ubuntu
# system, and having it enabled by default can lead to security issues on
# the console such as being able to dump memory or to kill arbitrary
# processes including the running screen lock.
#
# Here is the list of possible values:
#   0 - disable sysrq completely
#   1 - enable all functions of sysrq
#  >1 - enable certain functions by adding up the following values:
#          2 - enable control of console logging level
#          4 - enable control of keyboard (SAK, unraw)
#          8 - enable debugging dumps of processes etc.
#         16 - enable sync command
#         32 - enable remount read-only
#         64 - enable signalling of processes (term, kill, oom-kill)
#        128 - allow reboot/poweroff
#        256 - allow nicing of all RT tasks
#
#   For example, to enable both control of console logging level and
#   debugging dumps of processes: kernel.sysrq = 10
#
# 128 + 32 + 16
