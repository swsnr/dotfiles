Feature: Shell Completion
    We want to get the correct completion on the CLI.

    Background:
        Given SDKMAN! candidate list is up to date
        And   candidate ant is installed at version 1.9.9
        And   candidate ant is installed at version 1.10.1
        And   candidate crash is installed

    Scenario: Command list correct
        When the user enters " " into the prompt
        Then completion should propose "b, broadcast, c, current, d, default, flush, h, help, i, install, list, ls, offline, rm, selfupdate, u, ug, uninstall, update, upgrade, use, v, version"

    Scenario Outline: Commands complete
        When the user enters "<cmd>" into the prompt
        Then completion should propose "<completions>"
        But  completion should not propose <exclusions>
        Examples:
            | cmd | completions                            | exclusions |
            | b   | b, broadcast                           | /^[^b]+$/  |
            | c   | c, current                             | /^[^c]+$/  |
            | d   | d, default                             | /^[^d]+$/  |
            | f   | flush                                  | /^[^f]+$/  |
            | h   | h, help                                | /^[^h]+$/  |
            | i   | i, install                             | /^[^i]+$/  |
            | in  | install                                |            |
