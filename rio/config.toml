# Scroll
#
# You can change how many lines are scrolled each time by setting this option.
#
# Scroll calculation for canonical mode will be based on `lines = (accumulated scroll * multiplier / divider)`,
# If you want a quicker scroll, keep increasing the multiplier.
# If you want to reduce scroll speed you will need to increase the divider.
# You can use both properties also to find the best scroll for you.
#
# Multiplier default is 3.0.
# Divider default is 1.0.
# Example:
# [scroll]
# multiplier = 3.0
# divider = 1.0

# Navigation
#
# "mode" - Define navigation mode
#   • NativeTab (MacOs only)
#   • CollapsedTab
#   • BottomTab
#   • TopTab
#   • Breadcrumb
#   • Plain
#
# "clickable" - Enable click on tabs to switch.
# "use-current-path" - Use same path whenever a new tab is created.
# "color-automation" - Set a specific color for the tab whenever a specific program is running, or in a specific directory.
#
# Example:
[navigation]
mode = "CollapsedTab"
